## Heya!
### About me
I'm a full-stack engineer, currently working in a FinTech industry and teaching students basics of Computer Science/Programming. When I'm not working I spend a lot of time on my personal projects, trying to learn new technologies and improve on my skillset.

Technology I'm working with most of the time currently:
  - JVM - Kotlin, Scala
  - .NET platform with C#
  - JavaScript, Lua
  - C++

Game development and graphics programming enthusiast. Working with self-implemented OpenGL engines, Unreal Engine 5 and Unity3D


ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on:
  - scripts for roleplaying GTA V server ([V-Life](https://v-life.pl/)) hosted on [FiveM](https://fivem.net/) platform
  - adding visual scripting for FiveM non-tech developers (Inspired by Unreal Enine blueprint system)
  - Refactoring and expanding on my older project, uselessFS (Re-writing from C to C++, rethinking some of algorithms and structures used)
  - Diving into Reverse Engineering, currently going through some retro games
