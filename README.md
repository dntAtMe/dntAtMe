## Hey!
### About me
I'm a full-stack engineer, on a daily basis I'm working with DLT in Financial Technology and teaching students basics of Computer Science. When I'm not working I spend a lot of time on my personal projects, trying to learn new technologies and improve on my skillset.

Technology I'm working with most of the time currently:
  - JVM - Kotlin, Scala
  - TypeScript with React
  - .NET platform with C#
  - JavaScript, Lua
  - some C++
  - Rust / Golang

Game development and graphics programming enthusiast. Working with self-implemented OpenGL engines, Unreal Engine 5 and Unity3D.
Also big fan of machine learning and statistical analysis.

ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on:
  - scripts for ([V-Life](https://v-life.pl/)) server hosted on [FiveM](https://fivem.net/) platform
  - adding visual scripting for FiveM non-tech developers (Inspired by Unreal Enine blueprint system)
  - Expanding on my previous project - Virtual file system (Rewriting codebase, changes in algorithms and structures used)
  - Diving into Reverse Engineering
  - Creating TUI library for Rust
  - Server-based application, right now I'm implementing GraphQL API with Golang
