## Hey!
### About me
I'm a full-stack engineer, on a daily basis I'm working with DLT in Financial Technology and teaching students basics of Computer Science. When I'm not working I spend most of my time on personal projects, trying to learn new technologies and improve on my skillset.

Technology I'm working with most of the time currently:
  - JVM - Kotlin, Scala
  - TypeScript with React
  - .NET platform, C#
  - JavaScript, Lua
  - Python
  - Rust / Golang

Game development and graphics programming enthusiast. Working with self-implemented OpenGL engines, Unreal Engine 5 and Unity3D. 
I tend to look into different games and check how they're built.
Also big fan of machine learning and statistical analysis.

ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on:
  - Scripting ([V-Life](https://v-life.pl/)) server hosted on [FiveM](https://fivem.net/) platform
  - Virtual file system that provides safety based on RAID architecture
  - Working on FTP file explorer with React + TypeScript, Tauri and Rust
